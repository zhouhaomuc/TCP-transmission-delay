# TCP-transmission-delay
Measure the round-trip transmission delay of a TCP message between two machines. 
with the following TCP message sizes: 1-byte, 10-byte, 100-byte, 1,000-byte, 10,000-byte. 
Include the connection setup time in measured delays.
Compare this to the round-trip transmission delay of the UDP message between two machines. 
For comparison purposes, all measurements should be done on Linux machines of the UR graduate software lab.
